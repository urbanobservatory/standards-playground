# API standards playround

This is a **proof of concept** demonstration for mixing JSON-LD and JSON Hyper-Schema for different purposes, within
the Urban Observatory standards.

## Getting started...

You'll need a recent version of NodeJS that understands ES6 syntax, and a modern browser that understands async/await
among other things.

```
npm install
npm start
```

By default, it will launch a server listening on port `8080` and using `http://localhost:8080` as the base. You can set
the `PORT` and `BASE` environment variables to override these.
